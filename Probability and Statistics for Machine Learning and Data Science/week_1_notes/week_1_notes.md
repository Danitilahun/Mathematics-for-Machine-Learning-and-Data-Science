**Topic:** Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Machine Learning

*   **Importance of Probability & Statistics:** Understanding probability and statistics provides a framework for designing, interpreting, and adapting machine learning algorithms.
*   **Key Topics:**
    *   **Bayes' Theorem:** Calculating probabilities given events (e.g., rare illness test).
    *   **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):** Training models by maximizing the probability of the model given the data.
    *   **Gaussian Distribution:** Understanding squared error in linear regression through the Gaussian distribution.
    *   **Regularization:** Connecting regularization techniques (e.g., L2 regularization) to probabilistic assumptions.
    *   **Hypothesis Testing:** Testing the effectiveness of drugs or website features with accurate interpretation of concepts like confidence intervals and p-values.

**Topic:** Introduction to Probability

*   **Definition of Probability:** A measure of how likely an event is to occur.
*   **Basic Formula:** P(event) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of possible outcomes)

*   **Examples:**
    *   **Picking a Soccer Player:**
        *   3 soccer players / 10 total kids = P(soccer) = 3/10 = 0.3
    *   **Coin Flip:**
        *   P(heads) = 1/2 = 0.5 (for a fair coin)
    *   **Two Coin Flips:**
        *   Possible outcomes: HH, HT, TH, TT (4 total)
        *   P(HH) = 1/4 = 0.25
    *   **Three Coin Flips:**
        *   8 Outcomes
        *   P(HHH) = 1/8 = 0.125

*   **Venn Diagrams:** Used to visualize probabilities and sample spaces. The whole diagram represents the Sample Space.

**Topic:** Probability with Dice Rolling

*   **Example: Rolling a Six-Sided Die**
    *   Probability of rolling a 6: P(6) = 1/6

*   **Two Dice Rolls:**
    *   Probability of rolling two 6s (6, 6): P(6, 6) = 1/36
        *   Sample space size: 36 (6 possible outcomes for each die)

**Topic:** The Complement Rule in Probability

*   **Definition of Complement:** The complement of an event is the event *not* occurring.
*   **Complement Rule:** P(A') = 1 - P(A)
    *   P(A'): Probability of the complement of event A.
    *   P(A): Probability of event A.

*   **Examples:**
    *   **School Example:**
        *   P(soccer) = 0.3 (3 kids play soccer out of 10)
        *   P(not soccer) = 1 - P(soccer) = 1 - 0.3 = 0.7
    *   **Three Coin Flips:**
        *   P(three heads) = 1/8
        *   P(not three heads) = 1 - P(three heads) = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8
    *   **Rolling a Die:**
        *   P(6) = 1/6
        *   P(not 6) = 1 - P(6) = 1 - 1/6 = 5/6

*   **Key Idea:** The probability of an event *not* happening is 1 minus the probability of it happening.
*   **Venn Diagrams:** Visual way to understand concept of sample space


**Topic:** The Sum Rule in Probability

*   **Basic Idea:** P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) but only if A and B are *disjoint* (mutually exclusive).
*   **Disjoint Events:** Events that cannot occur at the same time (no overlap).

*   **Example 1: School Sports**
    *   P(soccer) = 0.3
    *   P(basketball) = 0.4
    *   P(soccer or basketball) = 0.3 + 0.4 = 0.7 (since kids only play one sport)

*   **Venn Diagram:**
    *   A U B (A union B): Represents the event "A or B" occurring.
    *   P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) (only if A and B are disjoint).

*   **Rolling a Die:**
    *   P(even) = 3/6
    *   P(5) = 1/6
    *   P(even or 5) = 3/6 + 1/6 = 4/6 = 2/3 (even and 5 are disjoint)

*   **Rolling Two Dice (Examples of disjoint) :**
    *   P(sum = 7) = 6/36
    *   P(sum = 10) = 3/36
    *   P(sum = 7 or sum = 10) = 6/36 + 3/36 = 9/36 = 1/4

*   **Rolling Two Dice (Events might not be disjoint, but still is in this case.):**
    *   P(Difference = 2) = 8/36
    *   P(Difference = 1) = 10/36
    *   P(Difference = 1 or 2) = 18/36
    *   8/36+10/36


**Topic:** The Sum Rule for Joint (Non-Disjoint) Events

*   **Joint Events:** Events that can occur at the same time (have overlap). The general equation must be used for non-disjoint events
*   **The problem with adding non-disjoint events:** A higher value for overall possibility may be present

*   **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle (Sum Rule for Joint Events):**
    *   P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)
        *   P(A U B): Probability of A or B occurring.
        *   P(A): Probability of A occurring.
        *   P(B): Probability of B occurring.
        *   P(A ∩ B): Probability of both A and B occurring (the intersection).
    *   The intersection is subtracted because when the events happen together, it is counted twice

*   **Examples:**
    *   **School Sports (Joint):**
        *   P(soccer) = 0.6
        *   P(basketball) = 0.5
        *   P(soccer ∩ basketball) = 0.3
        *   P(soccer U basketball) = 0.6 + 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.8
    *  **Note, the Venn diagram overlaps in joint functions

*   **Rolling Two Dice (Joint):**
    *   P(sum = 7 or difference = 1): First determine the probability of sum =7 which is 6/36 and probability of difference = 1 (10/36) . Then subtract P (sum =7 ∩ difference =1) =2,36  since the events overlap.
        *  Overall 6/36 + 10/36 - 2/36 = 14/36


**Topic:** Independence and the Product Rule in Probability

*   **Independence:** Events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other.
*   **Product Rule:** If A and B are independent events, then P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) (The probability of independent events A and B occurring together (intersection) is the product of their individual probabilities.)

*   **Example 1:** 40% like soccer, and 60% does not like soccer, Room 1 has 30 and Room 2 had 70, Given the soccer sample is split to what percent of kids in room one like soccer. (40% of the 30). P(S= 0.4, R1=0.3) P ( s ∩ R1)=p(s) p(R1)=0.4 * 0.3 =0.12

*   **Example: Flipping a Fair Coin 5 Times:**
        *   p(heads) 0.5
        *   P(all heads in 5 flips) = (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = (1/2)^5 = 1/32

*   **Example: Rolling Dice:**
    *   Rolling Two Dice (6-6) P= 1/6 * 1/6= 1/36
    *   Rolling Ten different Dice P= 1/6^10


**Topic:** The Birthday Problem

*   **Problem:** What is the probability that, in a set of n randomly chosen people, at least two people will share the same birthday?

*   **Counter-Intuitive Result:** The probability of a shared birthday is surprisingly high, even for relatively small groups.

*   **Approach:** Calculate the probability of *no* shared birthdays and then take the complement to find the probability of at least one shared birthday.

*   **Calculation:**
    *   P(no shared birthdays for n people) = (365/365) * (364/365) * (363/365) * ... * ((365 - n + 1)/365)
    *   P(at least two shared birthdays) = 1 - P(no shared birthdays)

*   **Results:**
    *   For 23 people, the probability of at least two sharing a birthday is approximately 50%.
    *   The probability quickly increases as the number of people grows. The results are highly counter intuitive!


## Conditional Probability: A Summary

Conditional probability is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred.  It's denoted with a vertical bar: P(A|B) reads "the probability of A given B."

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Impact of Information:** Knowing that one event has happened changes the sample space and, therefore, the probability of the other event.
*   **Example: Coin Tosses**
    *   P(Two Heads) = 1/4
    *   P(Two Heads | First Coin is Heads) = 1/2 (new sample space)
    *   P(Two Heads | First Coin is Tails) = 0 (impossible given the condition)
*   **Example: Dice Rolls**
    *   demonstration of conditional probability using the context of dice rolls.

**General Product Rule:**

*   For any events A and B (independent or not):
    *   P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

**Why this matters:**

*   Conditional probability is fundamental for understanding how events are related. It's used in many real-world applications, like medical diagnosis, risk assessment, and machine learning.  It's important for making informed decisions when you have additional information.

## Applying Conditional Probability: Examples

This part applies the concepts of conditional probability and independence through a few scenarios involving children in a school.

**Scenario 1: Soccer and Room Choice (Dependent Events)**

*   100 kids, 50 like soccer, 50 don't.
*   Two rooms: One with World Cup on TV, the other with a movie.
*   **Intuition:** Kids who like soccer are more likely to go to the room with the World Cup.  The events "liking soccer" and "choosing Room 1" are now *dependent*.

**Scenario 2: Soccer and Running Shoes (Dependent Events)**

*   100 kids, 40 play soccer, 60 don't.
*   80% of kids who play soccer wear running shoes.
*   **Goal:** Estimate how many kids play soccer AND wear running shoes.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   P(Soccer) = 0.4
    *   P(Running Shoes | Soccer) = 0.8
    *   P(Soccer ∩ Running Shoes) = P(Soccer) * P(Running Shoes | Soccer) = 0.4 * 0.8 = 0.32 (32 kids)

**Scenario 3: Combining Probabilities**

*   Additional Information: 50% of kids who DON'T play soccer wear running shoes.
*   P(Running Shoes | Not Soccer) = 0.5
*   **Goal:** Calculate probability of not soccer and wearing running shoes.
*   **Calculation**
    *   P(Not Soccer) = 0.6
    *   P(Not Soccer ∩ Running Shoes) = P(Not Soccer) * P(Running Shoes | Not Soccer) = 0.6 * 0.5 = 0.3 (30 kids)

**Probability Tree**

*   The video introduces a probability tree as a way to visualize and calculate the probabilities of all possible combinations of events (soccer/not soccer and running shoes/not running shoes).

**Recap: Dependence vs. Independence (Visual Representation)**

*   **Independent Events:** The lines separating the groups do not meet in a point in a graphical representation. Random events, and events that don't influence each other, are independent.
*   **Dependent Events:** The lines cross each other in a graphical representation. Events that have a causal relationship are dependent.

## Bayes' Theorem: Understanding Test Results

This part explains Bayes' Theorem using the scenario of testing for a rare disease. It demonstrates how to calculate the probability of actually having the disease given a positive test result, considering the test's accuracy and the disease's prevalence.

**The Setup:**

*   **Rare Disease:** Affects 1 in 10,000 people (100 out of 1 million).
*   **Highly Effective Test:** 99% accuracy.
    *   99% of sick people test positive (true positive).
    *   1% of sick people test negative (false negative).
    *   99% of healthy people test negative (true negative).
    *   1% of healthy people test positive (false positive).

**The Question:**

If you test positive, what is the probability that you actually have the disease? P(Sick | Positive)

**Breaking it Down (Out of 1 Million People):**

1.  **Initial Distribution:**
    *   100 Sick
    *   999,900 Healthy

2.  **Test Results:**
    *   **Diagnosed Sick:**
        *   99 True Positives (sick and diagnosed sick)
        *   9,999 False Positives (healthy but diagnosed sick)
    *   **Diagnosed Healthy:**
        *   1 False Negative (sick but diagnosed healthy)
        *   989,901 True Negatives (healthy and diagnosed healthy)

3.  **Calculating P(Sick | Positive):**
    *   You tested positive, so you're in the "Diagnosed Sick" group.
    *   Of the people diagnosed sick, how many are actually sick?
    *   P(Sick | Positive) = (Number of Sick and Diagnosed Sick) / (Total Number Diagnosed Sick)
    *   P(Sick | Positive) = 99 / (99 + 9999) = 99 / 10098 ≈ 0.0098 (Less than 1%)

**Key Takeaway:**

Even with a highly accurate test, if a disease is rare, the probability of actually having the disease after a positive test result can be surprisingly low due to the relatively high number of false positives.

**Visual Explanation (Probability Tree):**

The video uses a probability tree to illustrate the different possibilities and their probabilities, reinforcing the calculation.

**In Essence:**

Bayes' Theorem helps adjust our initial belief (prior probability) about having a disease based on new evidence (a positive test result) and the accuracy of the test.


## Bayes' Theorem: Formalizing the Calculation

This part presents the formal mathematical derivation of Bayes' Theorem and applies it to the rare disease testing scenario.

**Variables:**

*   A: You are sick.
*   B: You are diagnosed sick (tested positive).
*   A': You are NOT sick (healthy).

**Goal:**

Find P(A|B), the probability that you are sick given that you tested positive.

**Bayes' Theorem Formula Derivation:**

1.  **Conditional Probability:** P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

2.  **Expressing the Intersection (A ∩ B):**
    *   P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A)

3.  **Decomposing P(B) (Probability of Testing Positive):**
    *   You can test positive if you're actually sick OR if you're healthy (false positive).
    *   P(B) = P(A ∩ B) + P(A' ∩ B)

4.  **Expressing the Second Intersection (A' ∩ B):**
    *   P(A' ∩ B) = P(A') * P(B|A')

5.  **Putting It All Together (Bayes' Theorem):**
    *   P(A|B) = [P(A) * P(B|A)] / [P(A) * P(B|A) + P(A') * P(B|A')]

**Applying the Formula to the Disease Example:**

*   P(A) = Probability of being sick = 0.0001 (0.01%)
*   P(A') = Probability of being healthy = 0.9999 (99.99%)
*   P(B|A) = Probability of testing positive given you're sick = 0.99 (99%)
*   P(B|A') = Probability of testing positive given you're healthy = 0.01 (1%)

**Calculation (Plugging in the numbers):**

P(A|B) = (0.0001 * 0.99) / (0.0001 * 0.99 + 0.9999 * 0.01) ≈ 0.0098 (Less than 1%)

**Key Points:**

*   Bayes' Theorem allows you to update your belief about an event based on new evidence.
*   The prior probability (P(A)) of a disease being rare greatly impacts the posterior probability (P(A|B)) of actually having it even with a positive test.
*   The formula looks complex, but it's derived from basic conditional probability principles and the idea of partitioning the event space.


## Bayes' Theorem: Spam Filtering Example

This part demonstrates how Bayes' Theorem can be used in spam filtering to determine the probability that an email is spam based on the presence of certain words.

**The Setup:**

*   **Data:** 100 emails, 20 are spam.
*   **Goal:** Build a classifier to identify spam emails.
*   **Feature:** The presence of the word "lottery."

**Observations:**

*   14 of the 20 spam emails contain the word "lottery."
*   10 of the 80 non-spam (ham) emails contain the word "lottery."

**The Question:**

What is the probability that an email is spam given that it contains the word "lottery"? P(Spam | Lottery)

**Intuitive Approach (Simplified View):**

1.  **Focus:** Only consider emails containing the word "lottery." There are 24 such emails.
2.  **Calculation:** P(Spam | Lottery) = (Number of spam emails with "lottery") / (Total emails with "lottery")
3.  **Result:** P(Spam | Lottery) = 14 / 24 = 7/12 ≈ 0.583

**Applying Bayes' Theorem (Formal Approach):**

1.  **Variables:**
    *   A: The email is spam.
    *   B: The email contains the word "lottery."
2.  **Goal:** Find P(A|B) = P(Spam | Lottery)
3.  **Bayes' Theorem Formula:** P(A|B) = [P(A) * P(B|A)] / [P(A) * P(B|A) + P(A') * P(B|A')]

**Calculating the Probabilities:**

*   **Prior Probabilities:**
    *   P(Spam) = P(A) = 20/100 = 0.2
    *   P(Not Spam) = P(A') = 80/100 = 0.8
*   **Conditional Probabilities:**
    *   P(Lottery | Spam) = P(B|A) = 14/20 = 0.7
    *   P(Lottery | Not Spam) = P(B|A') = 10/80 = 0.125

**Plugging into Bayes' Theorem:**

P(Spam | Lottery) = (0.2 * 0.7) / (0.2 * 0.7 + 0.8 * 0.125) = 0.14 / (0.14 + 0.1) = 0.14 / 0.24 = 7/12 ≈ 0.583

**Conclusion:**

*   The formal application of Bayes' Theorem confirms the initial intuitive calculation.
*   An email containing the word "lottery" has a probability of approximately 0.583 (58.3%) of being spam, based on the given data.


## Prior, Event, and Posterior: A Framework for Bayesian Reasoning

**Key Definitions:**

*   **Prior Probability:**  P(A) - The initial probability of an event (A) occurring before any new information is considered. It represents your initial belief.
*   **Event:** E - A new piece of information that provides evidence related to the event of interest.
*   **Posterior Probability:** P(A|E) - The updated probability of the event (A) occurring, given the new information (event E). It represents your revised belief after considering the evidence. The posterior is a *better* estimation than the prior.

**Examples:**

1.  **Spam Email:**
    *   Prior: P(Spam) = (Number of spam emails) / (Total number of emails) = 20% (initial spam probability).
    *   Event: The email contains the word "lottery."
    *   Posterior: P(Spam | Lottery) = (Number of spam emails with "lottery") / (Total number of emails with "lottery"). The posterior is a more accurate estimate of spam probability based on the lottery word.

2.  **Medical Test:**
    *   Prior: P(Sick) = Original probability of being sick (very low for a rare disease).
    *   Event: Diagnosed positive (tested positive for the disease).
    *   Posterior: P(Sick | Positive) = Probability of being sick given that you tested positive (much lower than one might initially expect due to false positives).

3.  **Rolling Two Dice:**
    *   Prior: P(Sum is 10) = 3/36.
    *   Event: The first die is a six.
    *   Posterior: P(Sum is 10 | First die is six) = 1/6 (the possible outcomes are reduced).

4.  **Coin Toss:**
    *   Prior: P(Both Heads) = 1/4
    *   Event: The first coin lands in heads.
    *   Posterior: P(Both Heads | First is Heads) = 1/2 (the initial possibilities are reduced to two, rather than four).

**Summary:**

The prior, event, and posterior framework provides a structured way to incorporate new information and update probabilities, leading to more informed decisions. Bayes' Theorem is the mathematical tool that formalizes this process.


## Naive Bayes: Combining Multiple Features for Spam Filtering

This part explains how to extend the Bayesian approach to spam filtering by combining multiple features (words) using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

**The Problem:**

*   Building a spam classifier using multiple words (e.g., "lottery" and "winning").
*   Directly calculating P(Spam | Lottery and Winning) by counting emails containing both words can be problematic, especially with many words, due to data sparsity (few or no emails containing all the words).
*   The Naive Bayes algorithm is useful to bypass this potential issue.

**The Solution: Naive Bayes**

*   **The Naive Assumption:** Assumes that the presence of different words in an email are *independent* of each other. This is a simplification, as words often have dependencies.
*   **Breaking Down the Probability:**

    *   P(Lottery and Winning | Spam) = P(Lottery | Spam) * P(Winning | Spam)
    *   P(Lottery and Winning | Ham) = P(Lottery | Ham) * P(Winning | Ham)
*   **Generalization to n Words:**

    *   P(w1, w2, ..., wn | Spam) = P(w1 | Spam) * P(w2 | Spam) * ... * P(wn | Spam)
*   **Benefits of the Naive Assumption:**
    *   Avoids data sparsity issues (no need to find emails containing all n words).
    *   Makes the calculation much simpler by multiplying individual probabilities.
    *   Offers surprisingly good results in practice despite its naive nature.

**Naive Bayes Formula:**

P(Spam | Lottery and Winning) = [P(Spam) * P(Lottery | Spam) * P(Winning | Spam)] / [P(Spam) * P(Lottery | Spam) * P(Winning | Spam) + P(Ham) * P(Lottery | Ham) * P(Winning | Ham)]

**Example Calculation:**

*   **Prior:**
    *   P(Spam) = 0.2
    *   P(Ham) = 0.8
*   **Conditional Probabilities:**
    *   P(Lottery | Spam) = 14/20 = 0.7
    *   P(Lottery | Ham) = 10/80 = 0.125
    *   P(Winning | Spam) = 15/20 = 0.75
    *   P(Winning | Ham) = 8/80 = 0.1
*   **Result:** P(Spam | Lottery and Winning) ≈ 0.913 (91.3%)
*   As expected, the probability of an email being spam increases significantly when it contains both "lottery" and "winning."

**Conclusion:**

The Naive Bayes algorithm is a powerful and efficient method for combining multiple features to improve classification accuracy, particularly in scenarios where data sparsity can be a problem. Despite its simplifying assumption of independence, it often performs remarkably well in practice.


## The Role of Probability in Machine Learning

This part emphasizes the crucial role of probability in various machine learning tasks, both supervised and unsupervised.

**Machine Learning is Often About Estimating Probabilities:**

*   Many ML problems involve calculating the probability of something happening given certain conditions.
*   Conditional probabilities are central to many machine learning algorithms.

**Examples of Conditional Probabilities in ML:**

1.  **Spam Detection:** Calculate the probability that an email is spam given the words, recipients, attachments, and other features of the email.
    *   P(Spam | Features)

2.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine if a piece of text expresses happiness or sadness.
    *   P(Happy | Words in Text)

3.  **Image Recognition:**  Recognize if an image contains a specific object, such as a cat.
    *   P(Cat in Image | Pixels in Image)

4.  **Medical Diagnosis:** Determine the likelihood of a patient being healthy based on their symptoms and history.
    *   P(Healthy | Symptoms, History)

**Probability and the Bayes' Theorem.**

* The Bayes' Theorem can be employed to the machine learning in different scenarios by creating a tree of possibilities.

**Generative Machine Learning (Unsupervised Learning): Maximizing Probabilities**

*   Aims to generate new data that resembles the training data.
*   Image Generation: Maximize the probability that a set of pixels forms a realistic human face.
*   Text Generation: Maximize the probability that a sequence of words forms coherent and meaningful text.

**Example: Generative Models for Face Generation**

*   Goal: Train a model (e.g., StyleGAN) that can generate realistic-looking images of human faces.
*   The model tries to maximize the probability that the generated pixels create an image of a human face. The generated image resembles an individual but it is not a real person.
    *   P(Face | Generated Pixels)

**Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning:**

*   **Supervised Learning:** Aims to answer questions about the data (e.g., "Does this image contain a cat?", "Is this email spam?"). It involves learning from labeled data.
*   **Unsupervised Learning:**  Aims to find patterns and structure in unlabeled data (e.g., generating new faces, clustering data points).

**Summary:**

Probability is a fundamental concept in machine learning. Conditional probabilities are used to make predictions in supervised learning, while maximizing probabilities drives the generation of new data in unsupervised learning. The examples discussed demonstrate how probability forms the foundation for many machine learning applications.
