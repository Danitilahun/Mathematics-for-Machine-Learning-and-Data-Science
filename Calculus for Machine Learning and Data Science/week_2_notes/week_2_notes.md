## Multivariable Calculus: Week 2 Overview & Tangent Planes

**Focus:** Functions with two or more variables, their derivatives, and optimization techniques (gradient descent).

**Generalization from 1D to Multidimensional:**

| Concept     | 1D (Functions of one variable) | Multivariable (Functions of two or more variables) |
|-------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Tangent     | Tangent line                       | Tangent plane                                        |
| Optimization| Finding max/min on a curve          | Finding max/min on a surface                         |

**Challenges of Multivariable Optimization:**

*   Can become computationally complex, even for computers.
*This function is more complicated them with only 1 degree*

* There is always need for to learn method for better solution*

**Techniques Covered:**

*   Gradient descent:An method to solve it
*How  gradient descent is to use for optimization
. *But first lets take a view on Tangent Planes.

**Tangent Planes**

*   **1D Example:** Function `f(x) = x^2` (parabola).
        In one functions dimensions is good
        *   *You check and do functions on  a one variable data sets*
*   **Derivative:** Slope of the tangent line at a point. (Example: At (2, 4), the slope is 4.)
  The tan function in that slope is also for the points
*   **Multivariable Example:** Function `f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2` (a paraboloid).

 **How and What We Do**

*The tangents in more than one derivative, this tangent is not correct. It needs more then one function, the plane has multiple functions. It's similar on one function but is has the function needs to has cut in small faces in two sides. With three dimensions the tan functions  are called tangent planes. Is has all most the same in one d.*

*   Two inputs (x and y), one output (z or f(x, y)). It needs and access at 3  dimensions.
*     Function of the three Dimensions and has three coordinates.
* The X and Y , is the axis
   Each floor, this two,  or the F is equal the high*
*The plane are not line because are more points in the place, so is more then just a slope. And also because The tangent function needs too do that and get points with values* *

*   Not tangent lines, but *tangent planes*.
*   **Obtaining the Tangent Plane:**

*Tangent Plant, is more  like that you see,  that the plan in the side of two slices.* *If does not have that slices, with a value it does not work.* *
The tangent plant it similar in the line but you need to make two cuts into the space planes.*
*Tangent line and 3D  space
For planes we are in that case and needs to calculate tangency*

Fix *one points (the second value and that number in that two points, create more value for the equation). *

***We used two lines:
* The first is to fix the equal to with the space and slice it.*
The new parabola with other red parabolas *

The equal is to use the 2 red parabolas to do a tan functions
As we do get 2 points are crossing, the presents the values
And the tangent plane!
*  The important things, is how functions on tangent and is different that the one dimension that we had*
*  To check or know more on the calculation of that and derivatives is important*

1 Is y = 4 then we need and know at with  what does we have to work.
What is this derivative with respect to
We replace 2
Therefore this will give you some formula
Now the important is the with two and what the important functions are as y*
*  With the equal with this numbers ,  we had an slide at space. Then if create other value with 2 and you and with another parabola.
But you need and have formula, to know about dimensions and about the with two.

You need the 2 y*

*You are going to use a three dimensional function from before,  but now with 2 and other for value*
*With is values, does it makes to more or less points?
It doesn't get  confusing about it and next you create that functions, for that you need some formula or derivatives*

*There is to many derivatives to do it now*
*The derivative of each slides now and for the moment it good*

(I will stop it here, to prevent from doing all of it) *

*     Take two cases (slices).
        *  *With formula create the numbers and do what says with the formula*

*You will need to have is a two tangencial value for each value and to use it to calculate correctly.*
        *     Cut the space with planes and calculate the tangents on these planes.
                *This is another one what we did but if is another functions do create with 3 with that values the tangents*

*     Cut space to the plane is better and check that functions will create tangents on its functions
The correct one is actually see that each code works is better to use*
It it is easy to different those 2* *
                *    ""Any two lines that cross actually represent a unique plane""
*And the most important you get an three functions to be very very high careful to do those tangents*
In conclusion: *Take two different slice with all what we do for the previous points*


## Multivariable Calculus: Partial Derivatives

**Goal:** Understand partial derivatives of functions with two or more variables.

**Recall:** With 1D functions, you have a single derivative, representing the slope of the tangent *line*.

**Partial Derivatives: The Concept**

1.  **3D Visualization:**
        *   Imagine a function of two variables plotted as a surface in 3D space.
        * *Cut in 3D with multiple planes create paraboloid functions.*

2.  What is that if cut is needed at plane?
         * There is needed a red parabola
        * *On it, is a tangent slope on its function*

    *Create parabola one one variable and the functions to create it.*

         *You can cut a the direction to get red and also a point in a high level function but that value
Create you function*
3.  *After you do that, you get another formula on that value*

**How to form a Derivate a the high level function, for the rest and for you function and to calculate  value you create new numbers*

* To understand in this number what a means the partial derívate*
*Very easy to see the derivative formula

This is why we need partial derivative*
Now,

         *The formula are for X with Y as contant and to calculate it.*

   4. The question about this all.
How and what will we need the functions with equal 4 with constant and the all of a function with variable?

*You get what you do with one example you can do that. *We are going with constant function.
** The formula are now and it will continue with new methods for the point of Y and partial derivatives .
* You can put two variables to get what you want if  if can get the Y values.

*     *So we need partial derivatives,

  *       Treat Y (for partial deriv. w.r.t. x) as constant
 *Then it can the partial variable can be use to the value .  In another word X is the value* with constant*
   *Or the Y are always be as to the constants.

                *And that equal this  can't be a good functions *

**The code for Partial Derivative**

          *What  are now to be as a variable. Because there is constant we will work what that functions
**We need the partial derivatives for the code and what it will be with it to work*

1 The step is to create one one constant
All the derivative formula can solve it and we have the derivatives for it
This formula will be useful if they work with that formula. ""
.

****How to you use it the constant functions from the start?******

        *1 To get that to do the derivative by the one that what you are doing.* *That is what you need*

    1.  *Treat all other variables (except the one you're differentiating with respect to) as constants.

 ""So what can see? Is to function has a derivative and in another with constants, then there is two that what they can solve. ""

   We need to get that is what they can work, you need to work only that. ""
So to what I say? Well, to only two what they can works
  And for three or a thousands all it does the same.
"""You just used this way and can put 10 functions to solve derivative. ""

**The Partial Derivative to use.**
It is very simple, the formula, the rule or the chain with variable
""" Then the partial derivative can say any derivatives as 10, 099 derivative and this what they do from each variables"""

  "" ""So this will go a variable what they code what is to do it to use. ""

### The Steps by steps codes to work for it.
The codes has has two rules:

1 *Step one what functions? 2 That there a constants.
""" You solve that  2 + 7 to tell you to change the code to get and has that function and code to get the derivative with that the variables ""

The number *7 the derivative has, code to what they can solve that and is also 0 that is for variable.*
1 "" "You can get easy what the numbers to the good point to each to them

 *  With it all , can have all data has 100% for the functions*

"""You make the process from step by step and you will have the functions you create functions to put a"" "" "partial variables""" ".

"""""You put each rule , for you derivatives and you are good with it """ """""

   **To get the point to what is that good function. *

    **Formal Definition (Example with f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2):**

    1.  **Partial derivative with respect to x (∂f/∂x or f_x):**

        *   Treat *y* as a constant.
*You what to do is to create the y + x with a equal point

            *   Differentiate `x^2 + y^2` with respect to *x* using the standard derivative rules.
            *   `∂f/∂x = 2x + 0 = 2x`

        *Well, you is what is x, you now what is y then is derivative.
And we create in that step what we want*

2. You what to do to create the derivative  w =2X  of a new one with numbers. That is all

 "" ""So it will say is that a power. And if we can see can you. A to get functions of the one derivative "" ""
 * That the only thing that's it and nothing more

Now: 10 functions

## Gradient: Condensing Partial Derivatives

*   **Partial Derivatives:** Know them well!
*   **Gradient (∇f):** A *vector* containing all the partial derivatives of a function.
*   **Example:** If `f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2`:
    *   `∂f/∂x = 2x`
    *   `∂f/∂y = 2y`
    *   `∇f = <2x, 2y>` (the gradient vector)
*   **Dimensions:** If `f` has 17 variables, `∇f` will have 17 entries.
*   **Tangent Plane:** The gradient is a description of the slope.
*   **Gradient at a Point:** Substitute the values of the vector to get an specific value of a formula.

**Key Idea:** Finding minimums/maximums of multi-variable functions uses a similar concept to single-variable functions (finding where the derivative is zero).

*   **Single Variable:**  `f'(x) = 0` finds the minimum/maximum.  Example: `f(x) = x^2` -> `f'(x) = 2x = 0` -> `x = 0`
*   **Multiple Variables:** Find where *all* partial derivatives equal zero. This means that we're looking for tangent plane where all the lines tangent to the plane are equal to zero.
*   **Example:** `f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2` -> `∂f/∂x = 2x = 0` and `∂f/∂y = 2y = 0` -> `(x, y) = (0, 0)`
*   **General Rule:** Set all partial derivatives to zero and solve the resulting system of equations. This can be more complex than the example shown.


**Topic:** Optimization using partial derivatives (finding the coldest spot in a 2D sauna).

*   **Problem:**  Finding the coldest spot (minimum temperature) in a 2D sauna.  The temperature is a function of `x` and `y` coordinates: `T(x, y)`.

*   **Method:**
    1.  **Find Partial Derivatives:** Calculate `∂T/∂x` and `∂T/∂y`.
    2.  **Set to Zero:** Set both partial derivatives equal to zero:  `∂T/∂x = 0` and `∂T/∂y = 0`.
    3.  **Solve for Critical Points:** Solve the resulting system of equations to find possible `(x, y)` coordinate pairs (critical points).
    4.  **Evaluate:** Plug each `(x, y)` coordinate pair back into the original `T(x, y)` function to determine the temperature at each point.
    5.  **Identify Minimum:**  The `(x, y)` coordinate pair that gives the lowest temperature is the location of the coldest spot (minimum).

*   **Analogy:** Similar to finding the minimum of a 1D function by setting its derivative to zero, we find the minimum of a 2D function by setting both partial derivatives to zero.

*   **Example:**
    *   `T(x, y) = 85 - (1/90) * x^2 * (x - 6) * y^2 * (y - 6)`
    *   `∂T/∂x = - (1/90) * x * (3x - 12) * y^2 * (y - 6)`
    *   `∂T/∂y = - (1/90) * x^2 * (x - 6) * y * (3y - 12)`
    *   Solving `∂T/∂x = 0` and `∂T/∂y = 0` yields multiple potential (x,y) pairs.
    *   Evaluating `T(x, y)` at each candidate, it's found that (4,4) yields the minimum.


**Topic:** Linear Regression as an Optimization Problem

*   **Problem:** Finding the best-fit line (y = mx + b) to minimize the cost of connecting to power lines in a 2D plane. Cost is defined as the sum of squared distances (along the y-axis) from each power line to the line.

*   **Cost Function:**  `E(m, b)` represents the total cost, which is a function of the slope (`m`) and y-intercept (`b`).  The derivation of E(m,b) is shown.  It simplifies to: `E(m, b) = 14m^2 + 3b^2 + 38 + 12mb - 42m - 20b`.

*   **Solution using Partial Derivatives:**
    1.  **Calculate Partial Derivatives:** Find `∂E/∂m` and `∂E/∂b`.
        *   `∂E/∂m = 28m + 12b - 42`
        *   `∂E/∂b = 6b + 12m - 20`
    2.  **Set to Zero:** Set both partial derivatives equal to zero to find critical points.
    3.  **Solve the System of Equations:** Solve the resulting system of linear equations for `m` and `b`.
    4.  **Result:** The solution is m = 1/2 and b = 7/3
    5.  **Optimal Cost:**  E(1/2, 7/3) = 4.167

*   **Linear Regression:**  This problem is a classic example of linear regression, where the goal is to find the line that minimizes the sum of squared errors (distances) to a set of data points.

*   **Limitations:** Solving a large system of equations can be computationally expensive. The next videos introduce a method for minimization called Gradient Descent
